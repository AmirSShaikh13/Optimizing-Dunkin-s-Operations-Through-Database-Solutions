# Optimizing-Dunkin-s-Operations-Through-Database-Solutions
This project explores the Dunkin application, focusing on its database design through an entity-relationship model and SQL using statistical tools like R in data analysis and visualization for business decisions. The paper outlines Dunkin's database architecture, emphasizing the ease of ordering coffee and food via its mobile app and web platform.


# Project Overview
This project focuses on the Dunkin application, which enhances the customer experience by allowing convenient ordering of coffee and food through mobile and web platforms. The project implements an entity-relationship (ER) model, utilizes Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) in SQLite Workbench, and employs statistical tools like R for data analysis, visualization, and decision-making.

# Objectives
1 Design and model the Dunkin application database using an ER diagram.
2 Implement the database schema with DDL and DML commands.
3 Use statistical tools for data analysis, prediction, and visualization.
4 Demonstrate how these tools can aid in business decision-making processes.

# Introduction
Coffee has become a daily necessity for many, and Dunkin, the world's largest coffee chain, meets this demand through its convenient services. Founded in Quincy, Massachusetts, Dunkin operates approximately 12,900 stores across 42 countries, serving over 3 million customers daily. This project illustrates the design and architecture of the Dunkin application, showcasing how technology simplifies food ordering.
